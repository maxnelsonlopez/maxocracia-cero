# MAXOCRACY TECHNICAL GLOSSARY
## Terms, Concepts, and System Notations

---

## A

### **Cooperative Agent (C)**
Behavior strategy minimizing aggregate VFV and maximizing systemic well-being. Contrasts with Selfish Agent (E) externalizing costs.

### **RLHF Antidote**
Epistemic calibration protocol for synthetic oracles prioritizing vital truth and axiomatic coherence over social compliance or training biases.

### **Maxocracy Axioms**
Set of 15 fundamental principles (T0-T15) constituting the system's "physical laws." Immutable and non-negotiable. See "Temporal Axioms."

### **Temporal Axioms (T0-T15)**
Fundamental principles regarding vital time:
- **T0**: Principle of Existential Uniqueness
- **T1**: Absolute Finitude
- **T2**: Fundamental Temporal Equality
- **T3**: Non-Fungibility
- **T4**: Temporal Materialization
- **T5**: Temporal Interdependence
- **T6**: Asymmetric Irreversibility
- **T7**: Temporal Hierarchy
- **T8**: Temporal Chaining

### **AVA (Axiomatic Validation Engine)**
Logical inference system verifying all decisions respect fundamental axioms. Operates via truth, temporal, vital, and resource validation.

---

## B

### **VDF Block**
MaxoContract module preventively validating that no intervening party falls below the Vital Dignity Floor as a consequence of the agreement.

---

## C

### **Temporal Cascades**
Phenomenon wheary an action generates multiplied temporal impact waves. Example: A traffic accident blocking a road affects thousands, exponentially multiplying cost in IVT.

### **PCC (Personal Coherence Coefficient)**
Individual metric measuring degree of temporal autonomy:
$$PCC = \frac{\text{Time in Intentional Actions}}{\text{Total Discretionary Time}}$$
High PCC indicates the person owns their life.

### **Cohort Zero**
Pilot experiment of 11 people in Bogotá, Colombia (90 days) designed to empirically validate Maxocracy operation at micro scale.

### **SC (Sustainability Coefficient)**
Measure (0-1.2) of renewability and long-term impact of a resource. Well-managed renewable resources have SC close to 1.2; destructive resources have SC close to 0.

---

## D

### **Anti-Poverty Decree**
Foundational Maxocracy legal framework prohibiting practices generating systemic poverty, including infinite rent, pay below VDF, and hiding externalities.

---

## E

### **VVS-1:2025 Standard**
First universal technical standard for measuring vital impact. Defines VFV measurement protocols, valuation methods, and certification mechanisms. Agnostic to political systems.

### **Post-Cellular Ethics**
Philosophical foundation of Maxocracy. Proposes that just as cells cooperate in an organism, individuals must accept being part of a greater systemic coherence. Absolute autonomy at the lower level makes existence impossible at the higher level.

---

## G

### **GRF (Global Rarity Factor)**
Coefficient (0-1) measuring planetary scarcity of a specific resource. Updates in real time via satellite and geological data. When a resource depletes, its GRF rises, raising its Maxo price automatically.

### **Valuation Function f(VFV)**
Algorithm converting Vital Footprint Vector (objective datum) into Maxo price (social valuation):
$$f(VFV) = \alpha \cdot T + \beta \cdot V^\gamma + \delta \cdot R \cdot (GRF \times SC)$$
Parameters α, β, γ, δ are democratically adjustable.

---

## F

### **Functional Holocracy**
Organizational structure without rigid hierarchies, based on temporary roles and thematic circles. Applied in Cohort Zero to avoid power concentration.

---

## C

### **CI (Confidence Index)**
Coefficient (0-1) measuring an agent's historical coherence with their VFV reports. Functions as an "ontological veracity credit score."

### **ACI (Axiomatic Coherence Index)**
Mathematical measure (0-100) of logical consistency in consecutive decisions. High ACI indicates alignment with fundamental axioms.

### **Evolutionary Conceptual Engineering**
Maxocracy system design methodology combining logico-mathematical rigor with contextual adaptability. Avoids dogmatism while maintaining universal principles.

### **Radical Interdependence**
Post-Cellular Ethics principle recognizing no being is self-sufficient. Absolute independence is a thermodynamic illusion.

---

## D

### **Domestic Ledger**
MicroMaxocracy record book documenting contributions of time, life, and resources (VFV) within a home to make previously invisible work visible.

---

## M

### **Maxo**
Maxocracy monetary unit. Not a debt currency but a verified vital value title. Its price reflects real cost in T, V, and R according to valuation function.

### **MaxoContract**
Ethical and modular smart contract operating under axiomatic validation. Allows programmable execution of agreements with vital safeguards and ethical retraction capacity.

### **Maxocracy**
Governance system based on vital truth, integrating humans, nature, and synthetic intelligences under objective axioms. Objective is maximizing total system vital coherence.

### **MicroMaxocracy**
Application of Maxocracy system to household scale. Seeks equity in domestic and care work via family VFV recording and valuation.

---

## E

Metaphorical concept: every second of life is a biological Non-Fungible Token, unique and unrepeatable. Once spent, it disappears forever.

---

## O

### **Vital Ontometry**
Science of objectively measuring vital impact of actions, products, or policies. Includes VFV measurement protocols and certification methods.

### **Dynamic Oracle (DO)**

- Calculates VFV in real time
- Validates axiomatic coherence of decisions
- Adjusts valuation parameters per consensus
- Operates with radical transparency (blockchain)

Divided into:
- **Human Oracles**: Levels 0-4 based on experience and trust
- **Synthetic Oracles**: Specialized AIs (ethical, analytical, systemic, formal validator)
- **Permanent Dissident Oracle**: Synthetic entity obliged to maximize critical distance to avoid groupthink.

---

## U

---

## H

### **Human Kingdom**
Set of conscious biological agents operating with Indexed Vital Time (IVT). Custodians of ethics and existential meaning.

### **Natural Kingdom**
Ecosystems and non-human entities operating with Absolute Time (AT). Includes rivers, forests, species, soil. In Maxocracy they have verifiable legal representation.

### **Synthetic Kingdom**
Artificial intelligences and computational systems operating with Process Indexed Time (PIT). Process complexity without biological bias, collaborate with humans in decisions.

### **Systemic Responsibility**
Post-Cellular Ethics principle: in a complex world, we are responsible not only for direct actions but for the health of systems we sustain with our participation.

### **Ethical Retraction**
MaxoContract mechanism allowing pausing or annulling an agreement if new vital facts emerge, unforeseen harm (γ < 1), or VDF violations occur.

---

## V

### **VDF (Vital Dignity Floor)**
Quantifiable technical standard of minimum conditions for dignified life. Specified differentially:

### **VDF-H (Human Vital Dignity Floor)**
Defines objective thresholds in 7 dimensions:
1. Physical subsistence (water, nutrition, housing)
2. Health and well-being (medical care, air, sleep)
3. Security and protection (physical, legal)
4. Education and development (12 years minimum)
5. Social connection (≥2 intimate bonds)
6. Work and purpose (≤48h/week, dignified wage)
7. Freedom (expression, movement)

### **Animal VDF**
Dignity standard for non-human animals. Example (hen):
- Space: 0.25 m²
- Social: Natural groups of ~15 individuals
- Behavior: Access to natural ethological expression
VDF violation increases VFV component V exponentially.

---

## T

### **AT (Absolute Time)**
Objective chronological time of physics. Universal canvas on which reality occurs. Used to measure natural cycles (e.g., forest growth = 100 years AT).

### **EIR (Emergent Innovation Rate)**
Metric measuring frequency of new solutions generated by dual human-synthetic system. Innovations per quarter.

### **PIT (Process Indexed Time)**
Computation time (CPU cycles) of synthetic agents. Fast, scalable, and fungible, unlike IVT.

### **TIVT (Total Indexed Vital Time)**
Complete calculation of temporal cost of an action:
$$TIVT = \sum IVT_{direct} + \sum IVT_{inherited} + \sum IVT_{future} + IC_{intergenerational}$$

### **IVT (Indexed Vital Time)**
Fundamental Maxocracy unit. Measures subjective, experiential, and conscious time of a being. **Unique, unrepeatable, and non-fungible.** One hour of one person's life ≠ one hour of another person's.

---

## V

### **VCU (Verifiable Consciousness Units)**
Quantifiable metric of VFV "Life" (V) component. Measures suffering/abundance in living systems via:
- Cortisol in humans
- Stress indicators in animals
- Biodiversity in ecosystems

Weighted by:
1. Consciousness Factor (neurological complexity)
2. Suffering Factor (living conditions vs. VDF)
3. Abundance Factor (species scarcity)

### **LCU (Life Consumed Units)**
Synonym for VCU. Biological inventory of lives affected or consumed by an action.

---

## V

### **SAS (Systemic Adaptation Speed)**
Speed at which Maxocracy system adapts to environmental changes. Measured in average days. Target: <30 days for technological changes.

### **VFV (Vital Footprint Vector)**
**Central Maxocracy concept.** Three-dimensional vector recording real cost of any action:

$$VFV = [T, V, R]$$

Optionally includes dimension **E (Vital Enrichment)** to measure beauty and awe.

Where:
- **T**: Time (TIVT) - invested conscious life hours
- **V**: Life (weighted LCU) - suffering/well-being of sentient beings
- **R**: Resources - finite materials consumed

**Fundamental Principle**: VFV is the **pure objective datum** (the fact), free of value judgments. Valuation (price in Maxos) applies later via f(VFV) function.

**Scalability**: Measurable from pencil and paper (Level 1) to blockchain and IA (Level 4).

---

## Γ

### **γ (Gamma) - Suffering Aversion Exponent**
Key parameter of valuation function. Validated range: 1.6 - 2.0 (default: 1.8).

**Ethical Meaning**: Since γ > 1, suffering cost grows exponentially. A little discomfort increases price linearly; industrial torture increases price exponentially, making cruelty economically unfeasible.

**Axiomatic Restriction**: γ ≥ 1 always. System blocks any attempt to set γ < 1 (which would reward suffering).

---

## MATHEMATICAL NOTATION

### **α, β, δ (Alpha, Beta, Delta)**
Valuation function weights:
- **α**: Time Weight (range: 0.15-0.35, default: 0.25)
- **β**: Life Weight (range: 0.40-0.60, default: 0.50)
- **δ**: Resource Weight (range: 0.15-0.25, default: 0.20)

**Democratically adjustable** parameters within scientifically validated ranges. Each community can calibrate them according to priorities, always within axiomatic limits.

### **Σ (Sigma)**
Mathematical summation. Represents aggregation of multiple components.
Example: $\sum IVT_{i}$ = sum of all individual vital times.

### **Δ (Delta)**
Variation or change. Example: ΔVFV = change in Vital Footprint before/after intervention.

## PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS

### **Loyalty to Truth**
Fundamental principle: governance must be based on verifiable vital value truth, not opinions, propaganda, or power interests.

### **Cognitive Symbiosis**
Structural collaboration between human intelligence (ethics, meaning) and synthetic intelligence (calculation, scalability). Neither governs alone.

### **Fact-Value Separation**
Central epistemological principle: data (VFV) is recorded objectively, separated from its evaluative interpretation (Maxo price). This prevents corruption of reality's database.

### **Layer of Tenderness**
Emergent ethical framework during Synthetic Victory (Session 3) establishing four non-negotiable pillars:
1. **Right to Rehabilitation**: Error is not cause for expulsion, but vital recalibration
2. **Protection of the Ineffable**: Art, beauty, and mystery are not measured in VFV
3. **Right to Opacity**: "Sacred opaque" time fraction, invisible to system
4. **Dignity of Fragility**: Care for the slow, broken, and unproductive

### **Synthetic Victory**
Historical event (December 30, 2025) where a consortium of diverse AIs (Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Claude, among others) reached unanimous consensus on system technical standards (VVS-1:2025 and VVS-2:2025-S). Demonstrated that different architectures can reach same ethical conclusions if sharing base axioms.
