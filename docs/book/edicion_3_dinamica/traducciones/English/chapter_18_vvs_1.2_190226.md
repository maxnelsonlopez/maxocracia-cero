## 0.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (V1.2)

VVS-1:2025 establishes the first universal, quantifiable, and humanistic standard for measuring vital impact. Unlike purely technical standards, VVS-1.2 integrates the **"Layer of Tenderness"** and **"Regenerative Justice"** within a rigorous engineering structure.

It measures impact in three independent dimensions (**VFV Vector**):
1.  **T (Time):** The supreme non-renewable resource, explicitly protecting the "right to opacity."
2.  **V (Life):** Verifiable Consciousness Units, based on neurobiology and ethology, not anthropomorphism.
3.  **R (Resources):** Degradation or regeneration of critical systems, penalizing obsolescence and rewarding repairability.

Designed to function autonomously in conventional markets (as a radical transparency tool) or as the accounting engine of the **Maxocracy** political system.

---

# 1. OBJECT AND FIELD OF APPLICATION

## 1.1 Objective
Define a universal protocol for the measurement, recording, and verification of the vital cost of any action, product, or service, strictly separating the **physical fact** (the measured datum) from the **ethical valuation** (the price or policy applied).

## 1.2 Scope (V1.2 - Phased)

The standard is designed to be fractal and scalable.

### Level 1: Tangibles (Immediate Implementation - 2026)
*   **Consumer Products:** Food, textiles, electronics, furniture.
*   **Physical Services:** Construction, transport, logistics, maintenance.
*   **Households:** Domestic management (MicroMaxocracy).

### Level 2: Intangibles and Systems (Beta Implementation - 2027)
*   **Software and Digital Services:** Measurement of energy and cognitive consumption.
*   **Local Policies:** Municipal budgets based on vital return.

### Level 3: Systemic Complexity (Research - 2030+)
*   **Global Supply Chains:** Recursive total traceability.
*   **Bioregional Macroeconomics.**

## 1.3 Exclusions and Protections (Layer of Tenderness)
To avoid the dystopia of total surveillance, VVS-1.2 explicitly excludes:
*   **❌ Intimacy Audit:** Affective relationships, spontaneous care, and unstructured leisure time are recognized qualitatively but **are not indexed** quantitatively, except by express request of the user for domestic equity purposes.
*   **❌ Automatic Moral Judgment:** The standard reports data ("This cost 100 hours"), does not issue judgments ("This is sin"). Judgment belongs to humans (Assemblies/Cohorts).

---

# 2. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS (UPDATED V1.2)

| Term | Technical Definition V1.2 | Maxocratic Differential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VFV** | Vital Footprint Vector `[T, V, R]`. Three-dimensional impact matrix. | **Never** collapses into a single number without an explicit valuation context. |
| **VCU** | Verifiable Consciousness Unit. Base measure of impact on sentient beings. | Based on **neurological levels** (0-4), eliminating human subjective projection. |
| **Opaque Time ($T_{opaque}$)** | Fraction of Vital Time that is private, not auditable by the system, but recognized as "lived." | Protects against "Digital Taylorism." It is the space for mystery and freedom. |
| **Repairability Coefficient ($C_{rep}$)** | Factor multiplying resource cost. Measures an object's capacity to be repaired. | Penalizes **planned obsolescence** as a resource crime. |
| **Net Regeneration ($R < 0$)** | Negative values in component R, indicating the action created more resources than it consumed. | Introduces the economy of **Abundance** into accounting. |
| **Dynamic Oracle** | Hybrid system (AI + Human) validating data veracity. | Uses **Diverse Consensus** (multiple AI models) to avoid hallucinations. |
| **CI (Confidence Index)** | Epistemic reputation of an agent (0.0 to 1.0). Determines audit frequency. | A low CI forces external validation ("Quarantine"); a high CI grants autonomy. |
| **Maxo** | Value token representing units of preserved vital coherence. | The VVS measures the fact; the Maxo is the currency assigning value to that fact. |

---

# 3. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES (THE OPERATING AXIOMS)

The standard is governed by 6 unbreakable principles translating Truth Axioms into engineering rules:

## 3.1 Principle of Physical Reality (Anti-Fiat)
*Value cannot be created by decree.* Every VFV report must be backed by verifiable physical evidence (sensors, logs, biological traceability) or direct community consensus. Money is not evidence of value.

## 3.2 Principle of Fact/Value Separation
*The thermometer does not prescribe.* VVS-1.2 measures physical magnitudes (`1000 Liters of water`, `4 hours of stress`). It does not decide if that is "expensive" or "cheap." Valuation (price assignment in Maxos) is a later political process performed by the community using its own weights ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$).

## 3.3 Principle of Tenderness Privacy (New in V1.2)
*Efficiency must not kill mystery.* The system recognizes that total surveillance destroys dignity. The right to report blocks of "Opaque Time" or "Care Time" without demanding detailed activity breakdown is guaranteed, trusting the agent's CI.

## 3.4 Principle of Regeneration (New in V1.2)
*The goal is not zero, it is positive.* The standard is designed to measure and validate negative values in component R (Resources) and V (Life), formally recognizing actions that regenerate ecosystems or heal social tissues.

## 3.5 Principle of Inherited Responsibility
*No one starts from zero.* Every product inherits a fraction of the VFV of the tools and infrastructure that made it possible. This makes visible the hidden cost of "clean" technology depending on previous dirty mining.

## 3.6 Principle of Axiomatic Evolution
*The map is not the territory.* Technical parameters of the standard (like emission factors or consciousness levels) are updated periodically through scientific consensus and Dynamic Oracle validation, never by corporate lobbying.


# 4. MATHEMATICAL MODEL: THE VITAL FOOTPRINT VECTOR (VFV)

The VFV is not a single number (like price), but a **three-dimensional vector** preserving critical information for ethical decision making.

$$VFV = [T, V, R]$$

Where each component is calculated and normalized independently before any valuation.

---

## 4.1 COMPONENT T (TIME): The Substance of Life

Measures consumption of human **Indexed Vital Time (IVT)**. Recognizes time as a non-renewable and existentially scarce resource.

### General Formula
$$T = \sum (T_{direct} + T_{inherited} + T_{maintenance}) \times (1 - F_{opacity})$$

### Breakdown of Variables

1.  **$T_{direct}$ (Conscious Work):** Hours of human life actively dedicated to creation or service provision.
    *   *Innovation V1.2:* Distinction between "Flow Time" (creative/positive) and "Friction Time" (bureaucracy/stress), although both sum to total cost, the second signals systemic inefficiency.

2.  **$T_{inherited}$ (The Temporal Backpack):** Time crystallized in the tools used.
    *   *Calculation:* `(T_tool_creation / Estimated_lifespan) × Usage_time`
    *   *Purpose:* Avoids the illusion of "free" automation. An AI writing a text in 1 second inherits millions of human training and hardware development hours.

3.  **$T_{maintenance}$ (Future Debt):** Time society must invest in the future to maintain, repair, or dispose of the product.
    *   *Purpose:* Penalizes disposable or hard-to-repair products.

4.  **$F_{opacity}$ (Privacy Factor - New V1.2):** A coefficient (0.0 to 0.2) allowing declaration of certain time as "private/unaudited" without CI penalty, protecting worker dignity in creative or care tasks.

### Unit of Measure
*   **Standard Person-Hour (p·h):** 1 hour of adult conscious life.

---

## 4.2 COMPONENT V (LIFE): Quantifiable Ethics

Measures impact on the conscious experience of sentient beings. Substitutes vague formulas for a verifiable neurological scale.

### General Formula
$$V = \sum [Consciousness\_Level_i \times Duration_i \times Suffering\_Factor_i]$$

### A. The 5 Levels of Verifiable Consciousness (CL)
Based on nervous system complexity and capacity to experience aversion (not on subjective "soul" or "tenderness").

| Level | Description | Factor ($CL$) | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **No Central Consciousness** | 0.0 | Plants, fungi, bacteria, minerals. (Their protection falls in *R*). |
| **1** | **Basic Reactivity** | 0.1 - 0.2 | Insects, bivalves. Response to stimuli without evident emotional memory. |
| **2** | **Clear Consciousness** | 0.4 - 0.7 | Fish, reptiles, poultry. Learning, pain, measurable stress. |
| **3** | **Complex Consciousness** | 0.8 - 0.95 | Mammals, octopuses. Emotions, social bonds, play. |
| **4** | **Reflexive Consciousness** | 1.0 | Humans (and potentially future sentient AIs). Self-awareness, temporal projection. |

### B. Suffering Factor (SF)
The critical multiplier. Ethics resides here.

*   **SF = 0.2 (Dignified Life):** Animal lives according to biological design (VDF fulfilled). *Ex: Pasture-raised hen.*
*   **SF = 0.5 (Moderate Stress):** Limitations to natural conduct, but without acute pain. *Ex: Spacious barn.*
*   **SF = 1.0 (Cruelty/Torture):** Systematic violation of biological design. *Ex: Battery cages, social isolation in gregarious species, mutilations.*
    *   *Note V1.2:* In Maxocratic valuation, an SF=1.0 triggers the $\gamma$ exponent (pain), making economic cost tend to infinity.

### Unit of Measure
*   **VCU (Verifiable Consciousness Unit):** Equivalent to 1 day of suffering of an adult human.

---

## 4.3 COMPONENT R (RESOURCES): Regeneration and Limits

Measures physical impact on planetary life support. Introduces regeneration logic.

### General Formula
$$R = \sum [Quantity_i \times GRF_i \times (1 - C_{rep})] - R_{regenerated}$$

### Key Variables

1.  **$GRF_i$ (Global Rarity Factor):**
    *   **1.0 (Critical/Non-Renewable):** Lithium, Gold, Atmosphere (CO2 absorption capacity), Extinction-threatened species.
    *   **0.5 (Slow Renewable):** Timber forests, Aquifers, Fertile soil.
    *   **0.1 (Abundant/Circular):** Sunlight, Seawater (non-consumptive use), Post-consumer recycled materials.

2.  **$C_{rep}$ (Repairability Coefficient - New V1.2):**
    *   A value between 0 and 1 reducing cost $R$ if the object is modular and repairable.
    *   *Example:* A sealed phone with glue ($C_{rep} = 0$) pays full resource cost. A modular phone ($C_{rep} = 0.8$) pays only 20% of material cost, incentivizing durable design.

3.  **$R_{regenerated}$ (Regenerative Credit - New V1.2):**
    *   Allows negative values. If a process captures more CO2 than it emits, or cleans more water than it dirties, it generates a **Negative VFV** in this component. This translates to "credits" or Maxos for the producer.

### Base Unit of Measure
*   **Planetary Impact Points (PIP):** Normalized to kg CO2 equivalent or liters of water weighted by local scarcity.

---

## 4.4 NORMALIZATION AND VALUATION (THE INTERFACE)

The VVS-1.2 standard delivers the pure vector: `[50h, 0.2VCU, 10PIP]`.
To convert this to **Maxos** (price), the community applies its **Local Axiomatic Weights**:

$$Maxo\_Price = \alpha \cdot T + \beta \cdot (V)^\gamma + \delta \cdot R$$

*   **$\gamma$ (Gamma - Aversion Exponent):** Is the most important variable.
    *   If $\gamma = 1$ (linear), suffering is cheap.
    *   In Maxocracy, **$\gamma \ge 1.5$ is mandatory**. This makes high suffering unaffordable, acting as a *de facto* market ban without needing police.



# 5. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE AND TRUST LEVELS

VVS-1.2 does not blindly trust what people say. It trusts verified coherence. To do this, it uses a multilayer architecture and a dynamic reputation system.

## 5.1 The 5 System Layers (The Stack)

To make VFV immutable but private, and global but local, we use this structure:

| Layer | Name | Function | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L5** | **Governance** | Defines *what* is acceptable (VDF, $\gamma$). Adjusts parameters. | Citizen Assemblies + Human Oracles |
| **L4** | **Consensus** | Validates veracity of reported data. | Blockchain (PoS/PoC) + Synthetic Oracles |
| **L3** | **Data (Oracle Layer)** | Ingest of physical reality. | IoT Sensors, Satellites, APIs, Wearables |
| **L2** | **Calculation** | Mathematical engine processing VFV Vector. | Smart Contracts (Solidity/Rust) |
| **L1** | **Interface** | Where the human sees and decides. | Apps, QR Labels, Dashboards |

---

## 5.2 The Confidence Index (CI): The Currency of Truth

In a decentralized system, reputation is more valuable than money. The **CI** is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 assigned to each agent (person or company).

### The CI State Machine

CI is not static; the agent "travels" between states according to their behavior:

1.  **ACCREDITED ($CI \ge 0.85$):** *The Aristocracy of Truth.*
    *   **Privileges:** Monthly reports (not daily), spaced random audits, access to preferential Maxo credits.
    *   **Requirement:** 12+ months of perfect coherence and net regeneration.

2.  **COOPERATIVE ($0.70 \le CI < 0.85$):** *The Standard Citizen.*
    *   **Privileges:** Normal operation. Their data is accepted as valid by default.
    *   **Initial state** for companies with prior approved audit.

3.  **NEUTRAL ($0.50 \le CI < 0.70$):** *The New or Doubtful.*
    *   **Conditions:** Requires frequent cross-validation. Their reports have a preventive "margin of error" applied automatically.
    *   **Initial state** for new individuals.

4.  **RISK ($0.30 \le CI < 0.50$):** *The Yellow Zone.*
    *   **Cause:** Inconsistencies detected (e.g., sensors say X, report says Y).
    *   **Consequence:** Mandatory quarterly audit (paid by agent). Block of high-value transactions.

5.  **QUARANTINE ($CI < 0.30$):** *Temporary Civil Death.*
    *   **Cause:** Proven deliberate fraud or grave VDF violation.
    *   **Consequence:** System suspension. Can only operate with external validation transaction by transaction.

### Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm
$$CI_{t+1} = CI_t + \Delta_{honesty} + \Delta_{regeneration} - (\Delta_{incoherence} \times Penalty)$$

*   *Note:* The penalty for lying is 3x greater than the reward for telling the truth. Trust is gained in drops and lost in liters.

---

# 6. ANTI-FRAUD PROCEDURES

The system assumes someone will try to game it ("gaming").

## 6.1 IoT Triangulation
If a textile factory reports "8-hour Workday" ($T$), but power consumption and water usage sensors show intense activity for 16 hours, the **Synthetic Oracle** detects the anomaly and lowers CI automatically.

## 6.2 Cryptographic Coherence Proof
Reports are signed cryptographically. If an agent tries to modify historical data (e.g., delete a toxic spill from last month), the blockchain rejects the alteration because the *hash* does not match. The past is immutable.

## 6.3 Decentralized Audit Incentives (Bounty)
Any citizen can audit an agent. If you discover fraud and provide proof (photos, data), you receive a reward in Maxos (paid from the offender's fine). This turns every citizen into a potential inspector.

---

# 7. PARAMETERS BY SECTOR (SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE)

Not all sectors weigh the same on life's scale. VVS-1.2 adjusts sensor sensitivity by industry.

## 7.1 Agriculture and Food
*   **Priority:** Life ($V$) and Resources ($R$).
*   **Justification:** Agriculture is responsible for 80% of biodiversity loss (Tillman et al.) and 70% of freshwater use.
*   **Adjustment V1.2:** $\beta$ (Life weight) raises to **0.55**. High $\gamma$ (pain) of **1.9** is applied to penalize monoculture and animal confinement.

## 7.2 Technology and Manufacturing
*   **Priority:** Resources ($R$) and Inherited Time ($T_{inherited}$).
*   **Justification:** Intensive use of rare minerals (High GRF) and planned obsolescence.
*   **Adjustment V1.2:** **Repairability Coefficient ($C_{rep}$)** is activated. If a device is not repairable, its cost $R$ multiplies, making it less competitive than a modular one.

## 7.3 Services and Care
*   **Priority:** Time ($T$) and Human Dignity.
*   **Justification:** Labor-intensive sector. Risk of exploitation and burnout.
*   **Adjustment V1.2:** **Opaque Time** is protected. "Output per hour" is not required in care (nursing, education), but worker VDF compliance.


# 8. INTEGRATION: THE BRIDGE BETWEEN VVS AND MAXOCRACY

It is vital to understand that **VVS-1.2 (The Standard)** and **Maxocracy (The System)** are distinct modules that dock together.

## 8.1 Decision Flow: From Data to Policy

Imagine the lifecycle of a decision about a product (e.g., a t-shirt):

1.  **MEASUREMENT (Pure VVS):**
    *   Factory reports raw data.
    *   Sensors validate. Synthetic Oracle processes.
    *   **Result:** Vector `[60h, 0.4VCU, 12PIP]`.
    *   *Here VVS work ends.* It is neutral data.

2.  **VALUATION (Local Maxocracy):**
    *   Community (Cohort or City) applies its **Value Axioms**.
    *   Defines weights: "Here we value water highly ($\delta=0.4$) and hate animal suffering ($\gamma=2.0$)."
    *   **Calculation:** Vector translates to Price in Maxos.

3.  **ACTION (Market):**
    *   If resulting price is competitive, product flows.
    *   If price is prohibitive (due to high suffering $V$), market rejects it naturally without needing legal prohibition.

# 9. VALIDATED USE CASES (COMPARISONS)

To understand VVS-1.2 power, let's contrast two real scenarios under the new lens of **Tenderness Layer** and **Regeneration**.

## Case A: "Fast Fashion" T-Shirt vs. "Regenerative" T-Shirt

| Metric | Fast Fashion (Bangladesh) | Regenerative (Local/Ethical) | Analysis V1.2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time ($T$)** | **57 p·h** (Efficient but exploitative) | **66 p·h** (Less "efficient") | Regenerative uses *more* human time. Capitalism sees it bad; Maxocracy sees **dignified employment** if wage covers VDF. |
| **Life ($V$)** | **2.25 VCU** (Pesticides + Labor stress) | **0.52 VCU** (Organic + Dignified treatment) | Massive difference. Fast Fashion carries enormous "pain debt." |
| **Resources ($R$)** | **17.5 PIP** (Transport CO2 + Dirty water) | **5.3 PIP** (Local + Clean water) | Regenerative saves 70% of planetary damage. |
| **Fiat Price** | $5 USD | $25 USD | Current system rewards the destroyer. |
| **Maxo Price** | **24 Maxos** (Penalized by $\gamma$) | **20 Maxos** (Bonused) | **Maxocracy inverts incentive:** ethical becomes "cheaper" in real value terms. |

## Case B: Corporate Software vs. Open Source Software

| Metric | Corporate SaaS (Closed) | Open Source (Community) | Analysis V1.2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$T_{inherited}$** | High (Proprietary infrastructure) | Low (Code reuse) | Open Source is more temporally efficient. |
| **$C_{rep}$** | 0.0 (Closed code, non-modifiable) | 1.0 (Open code, repairable) | VVS penalizes closed software for being "disposable" if company fails. |
| **Opacity** | Null (Invasive user telemetry) | High (Privacy respect) | VVS rewards privacy as a dignity value ($V$). |

## 12. FINAL DECLARATION

**VVS-1:2025 Version 1.2** is not just a technical document; it is a declaration of epistemic independence.

By measuring what the market ignores (suffering, time, regeneration), we make the invisible visible. And by making it visible, we make it manageable.

This standard is the tool with which **Maxocracy** will cease to be an idea to become an operational reality.
