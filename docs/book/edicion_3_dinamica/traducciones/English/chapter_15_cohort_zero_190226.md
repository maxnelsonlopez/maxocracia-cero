# Cohort Zero: Experimental Validation in Bogotá

> **Editorial Note:** Edition 3.3 — Revised on January 26, 2026. Integrates the "Cohort Zero Playbook," the "Experiment Metrics," and key references to MicroMaxocracy and MaxoContracts.

## 15.1 From Theory to the Trenches: The Living Laboratory

Maxocracy is not a paper utopia; it is a social engineering system designed to function in dirty, complex, and imperfect reality. We cannot wait to convince a whole country to change its constitution. Systemic change begins in fractal: a small functional unit demonstrating, with empirical evidence, that the model is superior.

That unit is **Cohort Zero**.

This chapter is not just philosophical speculation; it is an operations manual. It describes the exact protocol for deploying the first Maxocracy cell in Bogotá, Colombia. The goal is not to "save the world" immediately, but to validate that a human group of 5 to 15 people can operate, sustain itself, and prosper using VFV and the Maxo as their primary coordination tools.

### Guiding Principle
We do not seek perfection, we seek the truth of experience. We are scientists of our own existence. We document our successes, but we celebrate our failures, because they are the most valuable data.

## 15.2 Operational Structure: Functional Holocracy

To prevent the experiment from degenerating into chaos, Cohort Zero operates under a strict **Supreme Hierarchy**:

1.  **Level 1: Principles (Immutable).** Need satisfaction (VDF), positive sum, and axiomatic truth are above any leader.
2.  **Level 2: Functions and Laws.** Game rules derive from principles.
3.  **Level 3: Mechanisms.** Tools (software, meetings) serve the laws.

### Nuclear Roles
Unlike the pyramidal structure, here roles are defined by responsibility:

*   **Cohort Coordinator:** Does not command, facilitates. Maintains rhythm and monitors the group's vital signs.
*   **Circle Facilitators:** Engineers of daily collaboration (Needs, Education, Technology).
*   **Active Participants:** Ethical pioneers with "skin in the game."

## 15.3 Implementation Methodology: The Three Phases

The experiment is designed to run in an intensive 90-day cycle, replicable and scalable.

### PHASE 1: The Ontological Awakening (Month 1 - Observation)
*Goal: See the invisible. Develop the capacity to observe life through the lenses of Maxocracy.*

#### Play 1.1: The Cohort Pact
Ceremonial meeting where each member commits to:
1.  **Radical Honesty:** Be brutally honest about their use of time.
2.  **Non-Penalization:** Do not judge others' logs.
3.  **Confidentiality:** What happens in the cohort, stays in the cohort.

#### Play 1.2: The Vital Time Log (IVT Log)
For 30 days, each member fills a simple spreadsheet with their waking hours classified into:
*   **T_maintenance:** Basic functioning (eating, hygiene, transport).
*   **T_investment:** Building capitals (work, study, relationships, **MicroMaxocracy** — see Chap. 16).
*   **T_leak:** Lost time, without intention or real enjoyment.

#### Play 1.3: The Nest Audit
Weekly checklist on one's own Vital Dignity Floor (VDF). Did I have access to good nutrition? Is my housing safe? We detect deficiencies the group can solve.

### PHASE 2: The Accounting of Existence (Month 2 - Quantification)
*Goal: Measure what we see. Introduction of VFV and Beta Maxo.*

#### Play 2.1: My Lunch's VFV
Practical exercise: Calculate the VFV of a daily meal.
*   $T$: Preparation minutes.
*   $V$: Ingredients (animal/vegetal) weighted by suffering (see Chap. 9 VDF-A).
*   $R$: Packaging and energy.

#### Play 2.2: The Genesis of Beta Maxo
Each member receives an initial allocation of 1,000 Mβ (tokens without real monetary value, experiment points) to start transacting.

#### Play 2.3: The Favor Market
Small exchanges are "priced" in Beta Maxo:
*   "I help move furniture: 20 Mβ."
*   "I review a text: 15 Mβ."
This trains the brain to value time and effort under the logic of **MaxoContracts** (see Chap. 17).

### PHASE 3: Coherent Governance (Month 3 - Collective Action)
*Goal: Operate as a micro-economy.*

#### Play 3.1: The Common Fund
The cohort allocates a percentage (e.g., 10%) of its Mβ to a fund for collective objectives.

#### Play 3.2: The Weighted Proposal
Any member proposes using the Common Fund (e.g., "Buy a shared drill"). The decision is made through **Intelligent Participation**: those who have researched most have greater weight in the decision, validated by simulated oracles.

## 15.4 Success Metrics: Truth is Not Felt, It is Measured

At the end of the 90 days, we will not publish an ideological manifesto, but an **Audit Report** based on hard data.

### Internal Health Metrics

**1. Needs Coverage Rate (NCR)**
*   **Definition:** $\%$ of critical needs (VDF) resolved by the group internally.
*   **Goal:** $> 80\%$. If people still depend on the external system to eat or feel safe, we failed.

**2. Maxo Circulation Velocity ($V_M$)**
*   **Definition:** Frequency with which a Maxo changes hands.
*   **Goal:** $V_M >$ Average of local currency. In trust, money circulates fast.

**3. Conflict Resolution Index**
*   **Goal:** $100\%$ internal resolution through mediation protocols, without resorting to external legal systems.

### Vital Impact Metrics ($\Delta VFV$)

We compare the group's consumption *before* vs. *during* the experiment:
*   $\Delta T$: Did they save time by collaborating?
*   $\Delta V$: Did they consume less animal suffering (LCU)?
*   $\Delta R$: Did they reduce resource waste?

**Global Goal:** Demonstrate that 11 people lived better, spent less life, and were freer.

## 15.5 Safety and Closure Protocols

An ethical experiment must know when to stop. We will activate the **Abort Protocol** if:
1.  **Damage to VDF:** Any participant falls below their vital dignity due to the experiment.
2.  **Sectarianism:** The group isolates itself from external reality.
3.  **Technical Insolvency:** Catastrophic loss of records.

### Closing the First Cycle
A brutally honest retrospective is held:
*   What did we learn about our time?
*   What was hard to measure?
*   Did our micro-economy work?

The result is the "Cohort Zero Findings Report v1.0," the first empirical evidence that Maxocracy is possible.
