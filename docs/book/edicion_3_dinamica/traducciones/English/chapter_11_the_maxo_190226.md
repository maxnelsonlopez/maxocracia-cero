# The Maxo: Vital Currency Architecture

> **Editorial Note:** Edition 3.2 — Revised on January 26, 2026, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), integrating the documents "Cohort Zero Playbook," "MicroMaxocracy," and "MaxoContracts."

## 11.1 Beyond Fiat Money

Current money is a debt promise. It is printed at the will of central banks and its value depends on trust (or coercion) of the State. It has no anchor in physical reality.

The **Maxo** is different. It is not debt currency; it is a **verified vital value title**.
Each Maxo in circulation represents a unit of systemic coherence that has already been created or preserved. You cannot "print" Maxos without creating real value (IVT) or regenerating life (V).

The Maxo is the first currency designed not to facilitate blind exchange, but to **reveal the ontological cost** of each transaction.

---

## 11.2 The Maxo Must Be Built

Unlike cryptocurrencies born by technical decree, the Maxo emerges from **validated social practice**. There is no "Central Maxo" deciding to create the system. The Maxo is built from below, through communities experimenting with its principles.

Maxocracy proposes **three convergent paths** to reach the Maxo:

```
                    ┌────────────────────┐
                    │       MAXO         │
                    │  (Vital Currency)  │
                    └────────────────────┘
                             ▲
           ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
           │                 │                 │
    ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌──────┴──────┐
    │   PATH 1    │   │   PATH 2    │   │   PATH 3    │
    │ Cohort      │   │ Micro-      │   │ Maxo-       │
    │ Zero        │   │ Maxocracy   │   │ Contracts   │
    └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
    11 people         1 household       1 contract
    90 days           Domestic Equity   5 blocks
```

These paths are not mutually exclusive; they are **complementary fractals** allowing validation of Maxocratic principles at different scales and contexts.

## 11.3 Path 1: Cohort Zero (The Bogotá Experiment)

**Cohort Zero** is the laboratory where theory meets real human experience.

### Guiding Principle
> "We do not seek perfection, we seek the truth of experience. We are scientists of our own existence."

### Structure

| Aspect | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Participants** | 11 committed people |
| **Duration** | 90 days (3 phases of 30 days) |
| **Budget** | $50 USD for tools |
| **Tools** | Discord/Telegram + Google Sheets |
| **Objective** | Validate VFV in real conditions |

### The 3 Phases

**Phase 1: Ontological Awakening (Month 1)**
- Cohort Pact (Radical Honesty, Non-Penalization, Confidentiality).
- **Vital Time Log (IVT Log)**: Each member records their hours in 3 categories:
  - T_maintenance (basics to function)
  - T_investment (building capitals)
  - T_leakage (time without intention)
- Nest Audit (Weekly VDF Checklist).

**Phase 2: The Accounting of Existence (Month 2)**
- **My Lunch's VFV**: Calculate the VFV of a daily meal.
- **Genesis of Maxo Beta**: Initial allocation of 1,000 Mβ (practice tokens).
- **First Favor Market**: Real exchanges valued in Maxo Beta.
  - "Can someone help me move furniture? I offer 20 Mβ."
  - "I'll review a document for 15 Mβ."

**Phase 3: Coherent Governance (Month 3)**
- **Common Fund**: 10% of Maxo Beta for collective goals.
- **Weighted Proposal**: Decisions by consensus based on axiomatic coherence.
- **Retrospective**: Findings Report v1.0.

### Success Metrics
- 80% sustained participation.
- ≥5 unexpected discoveries documented.
- Methodological innovations proposed by the cohort.

## 11.4 Path 2: MicroMaxocracy (Domestic Equity)

**MicroMaxocracy** applies Maxocratic principles to the home. It is preparation for Maxocratic citizenship.

### The Problem
- Women: 12.6 hours/week in domestic tasks.
- Men: 5.7 hours/week.
- Ratio: 2.2 to 1.
- At current rate: full equity only in ~2066.

> "What is not measured is not valued. What is not valued does not change."

### The Three Accounts Model

```
Equilibrium = α×(DDC/total) + β×(EHC/total) + γ×(AET/total)

Where:
α = 0.6 (weight direct domestic work)
β = 0.3 (weight economic contribution)
γ = 0.1 (weight available time)
```

| Account | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **DDC** | Direct Domestic Contributions (measured in VFV) |
| **EHC** | Economic Household Contributions (% income contributed) |
| **AET** | Available Energy Time (hours after work/rest) |

### Adoption Levels

| Level | Description | Tools |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **0: Awareness** | 3 conversations of 15 min | No measurement |
| **1: Informal Record** | Document without weightings | Simple app |
| **2: Systematic Record** | Ledger + agreed weightings | VFV calculated |
| **3: Structured Audit** | Cross-checks, adjustments | Mediation if necessary |
| **4: Digital Optimization** | Sensors, predictive AI | Full stack |

### Impact
Children growing up in MicroMaxocratic households learn that:
- Decisions are based on data, not power.
- Transparency reduces conflicts.
- Invisible work must be recognized.

## 11.5 Path 3: MaxoContracts (Ethical Smart Contracts)

**MaxoContracts** are the legal infrastructure of the Maxocratic economy.

### The Problem with Current Contracts

| Traditional Contracts | Smart Contracts | MaxoContracts |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Obfuscated jargon | Technical/inaccessible | Civil language + code |
| Rigid (litigation) | Immutable | Ethical retraction |
| Post-conflict | Amoral | Axiomatic validation |

> "You cannot create an exploitative contract even if you try."

### The 5 Fundamental Blocks

Users **do not write code**. They drag pre-validated blocks:

```
1. ConditionBlock:     If [verifiable_event] then [action]
2. ActionBlock:        Execute [transfer/access/service]
3. WellnessProtector:  If [suffering > threshold] then [retract]
4. VDFValidator:       Validate that [no party falls below VDF]
5. ReciprocityBlock:   Verify that [exchange is balanced in VFV]
```

### Anti-Poverty Decree: Prohibited Practices

| Practice | Prohibition | Maxocratic Alternative |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Infinite Rent** | Charging without transfer after cost recovery | Leasing with automatic transfer |
| **Unfair Payment** | Remuneration below VDF | VDF as wage floor |
| **Hidden Externalities** | Costs not reflected | Mandatory VFV accounting |
| **Irreversible Transfers** | No retraction upon harm | Validated ethical retraction |

### Ethical Retraction
Contracts can be retracted if new vital facts emerge:
1. **Request** (user presents evidence).
2. **Pre-Validation** (Synthetic Oracle, <5 seconds).
3. **Human Validation** (Human Oracle, 24-48h).
4. **Automatic Execution** (compensation + renegotiation).

## 11.6 The Maxo Valuation Function

How do you put a price on something in this economy? Blind supply and demand doesn't dictate it. It is dictated by an algorithmic function processing the Vital Footprint Vector (VFV).

**The Master Formula:**
$$Maxo\_Price = \alpha \cdot T + \beta \cdot V^\gamma + \delta \cdot R \cdot (FRG \times SC)$$

### Component T: Time
$$Value_T = \alpha \cdot T$$
- **T**: Total Indexed Vital Time (TIVT) invested.
- **α** (Time Weight): Governance parameter. **α > 0 is an immutable axiom** (no one can be enslaved for free).

### Component V: Life with Pain Exponent
$$Value_V = \beta \cdot V^\gamma$$
- **V**: Life Consumed Units (LCU) weighted by consciousness.
- **β**: Weight of biological life.
- **γ** (Suffering Aversion Exponent): **γ > 1** means suffering grows exponentially.
  - Mild discomfort → linear increase.
  - Industrial torture → exponential increase (economically inviable).

### Component R: Resources
$$Value_R = \delta \cdot R \cdot (FRG \times SC)$$
- **R**: Physical quantity consumed.
- **FRG** (Geological Rarity Factor): If lithium runs out, FRG rises automatically.
- **SC** (Systemic Criticality): Lithium for pacemakers = low SC; lithium for toy = high SC.

## 11.7 The Dynamic Oracle and Parameters

Who decides how much α, β, γ, δ are worth?

It is not an opaque central bank. It is the **Dynamic Oracle (DO)**, a hybrid system:

1. **Community Voting**: Society decides priorities ("Do we raise β to protect forests?").
2. **Real-Time Data**: Satellite sensors update FRG automatically.
3. **Axiomatic Restrictions**: The system blocks:
   - γ < 1 (rewarding suffering).
   - α = 0 (slavery).

---

## 11.8 Case Studies: The Economy of Truth

Applying the formula, we see how the market transforms:

### Industrial vs. Ethical Egg

| Type | Cost T | Cost V | Maxo Price |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Industrial** | Low (automation) | High (suffering γ) | 45 Maxos |
| **Ethical** | Higher (manual care) | Minimum | 12 Maxos |

**Result**: In Maxocracy, **the ethical is cheaper** because it doesn't drag the "ontological fine" of suffering.

### Transport: Plane vs. Train

| Mode | Cost R | Maxo Price |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Plane** | High (fossil, high FRG) | 420 Maxos |
| **Electric Train** | Low (renewable) | 85 Maxos |

---

## 11.9 Retroactive Responsibility: The End of Obsolescence

The Maxo introduces **Retroactive Dynamic Pricing**:

When you buy a fridge, you pay a price based on its promised duration (e.g., 10 years).
- If it breaks at 2 years → the manufacturer **returns the difference** in Maxos.
- If it lasts 20 years → the manufacturer receives **automatic bonus**.

This aligns, for the first time in history, the profit incentive with real durability.

---

## 11.10 Anti-Hoarding Mechanisms

To avoid extreme inequality:

1. **Progressive Hoarding Tax**: The cost of resource n+1 is higher than resource n.
2. **Custodial Levy**: If you have a critical resource and don't use it productively, you pay for "holding vital potential."

---

## 11.11 Synthesis: A Currency That Thinks

The Maxo is not dumb money. It is intelligent, ethical money, connected to the earth.

By adopting the Maxo, we don't just change how we buy; we change how we value. We move from an extraction economy (where whoever takes the most wins) to a **coherence economy** (where whoever preserves the most life wins).

The three paths—Cohort Zero, MicroMaxocracy, MaxoContracts—are the laboratories where the Maxo is forged. We don't expect the world to adopt our currency by decree. We build it, we test it, we improve it. And when it works on a small scale, it will scale itself.

The code is written. The logic is solid. Only the will to use it is missing.
