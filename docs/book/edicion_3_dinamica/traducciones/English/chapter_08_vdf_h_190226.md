# Vital Dignity Floor for Humans (VDF-H)

> **Editorial Note:** Edition 3.2 — Revised on January 26, 2026, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), integrating the technical document "VDF-H: Comprehensive Proposal for the Quantification of Existential Minimums" (López Restrepo & MiniMax Agent, 2025).

## 8.1 From Rhetoric to Engineering: The End of Ambiguity

For centuries, we have spoken of "human rights," "dignity," and "decent life." But what exactly do they mean? For a politician, "decent housing" might be a tin shelter; for an architect, a ventilated apartment. This ambiguity has allowed poverty to hide behind adjectives.

The **Vital Dignity Floor for Humans (VDF-H)** ends poetry and begins engineering. It is not a declaration of good intentions; it is a quantifiable technical standard. It defines the exact threshold below which human life loses its biological and psychological integrity.

**Operational Definition**: The VDF-H is the set of measurable, verifiable, and enforceable parameters establishing the minimum conditions required for a dignified human life. Developed within the theoretical framework of Maxocracy, it transforms abstract human rights declarations into quantifiable metrics.

In Maxocracy, the VDF-H is not a goal to reach "someday." It is the **operational baseline**. Any system keeping human beings below this floor is, by definition, a failed and illegitimate system, regardless of its GDP.

---

## 8.2 The Three Epistemological Pillars

The VDF-H was not invented out of thin air. It is built on three pillars validated by science and ethics:

### Pillar 1: Intrinsic Dignity (The Right)

Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

> *"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."* — UDHR, Article 1

**Foundation**: Dignity is not granted by institutions but recognized as an inherent attribute. VDF-H standards do not "grant" dignity but establish the minimum conditions for its practical materialization.

**Practical Implication**: No human being can be kept below these thresholds without violating their intrinsic dignity, regardless of economic, political, or cultural circumstances.

### Pillar 2: Fundamental Capabilities (The Power)

Based on Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum:

It is not enough to provide resources; it is necessary to ensure people can effectively convert these resources into valuable functionings.

**Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities** applied to VDF-H:
1. Life
2. Bodily Health
3. Bodily Integrity
4. Senses, Imagination, and Thought
5. Emotions
6. Practical Reason
7. Affiliation
8. Other Species
9. Play
10. Control over one's environment

### Pillar 3: Universal Needs (The Structure)

Based on Manfred Max-Neef:

Human needs are finite, classifiable, and universal. Max-Neef identifies 9 needs that must be satisfied simultaneously:

| Need | Corresponding VDF-H Parameters |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Subsistence | Food, housing, health |
| Protection | Security, health systems, rights |
| Affection | Relationships, family, intimacy |
| Understanding | Education, communication, consciousness |
| Participation | Responsibilities, rights, work |
| Leisure | Games, parties, tranquility |
| Creation | Skills, techniques, work |
| Identity | Symbols, language, values |
| Freedom | Equal rights, autonomy |

---

## 8.3 Parameter Validation Criteria

Every parameter included in the VDF-H must meet **five strict criteria**:

### 1. Quantitatively Measurable
- Expressible in objective units (meters, liters, hours, percentages)
- Usable with standard measurement instruments
- Replicable by independent observers

### 2. Independently Verifiable
- Auditable by third parties without conflict of interest
- Standardized verification protocols
- Complete data and methodology traceability

### 3. Research Based
- Grounded in peer-reviewed scientific literature
- Consensus of recognized specialized organizations
- Empirical evidence of correlation with well-being

### 4. Social Consensus
- Majority acceptance in informed deliberation
- Compatible with diverse cultural values
- Democratic legitimacy in participatory processes

### 5. Contextualizable
- Adaptable to specific geographical and cultural conditions
- Scalable from local communities to nations
- Flexible in the face of extraordinary circumstances (emergencies, transitions)

## 8.5 The Violation Formula

How do we know if a society is failing? Maxocracy introduces an auditing formula:

$$VDF\_Violation = \sum [(VDF_{required} - VDF_{actual}) \times Weight \times Duration \times Intensity]$$

Where:
- **VDF_required**: Standard value established for each parameter.
- **VDF_actual**: Value measured in specific reality.
- **Weight**: Relative importance of each dimension (sum = 1.0).
- **Duration**: Accumulated time of violation (months).
- **Intensity**: Severity of lack (1.0 = mild, 2.0 = severe, 3.0 = extreme).

### Proposed Dimensional Weights

| Dimension | Weight | Justification |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **I. Physical Subsistence** | 0.25 (25%) | Biological base of life |
| **II. Health and Well-being** | 0.20 (20%) | Bodily functioning |
| **III. Security and Protection** | 0.15 (15%) | Physical integrity |
| **IV. Education and Development** | 0.15 (15%) | Human potential |
| **V. Social Connection** | 0.10 (10%) | Psychological well-being |
| **VI. Meaningful Work** | 0.10 (10%) | Purpose and dignity |
| **VII. Freedom and Participation** | 0.05 (5%) | Full autonomy |

### Applied Example

**Case**: Person in urban poverty situation.

**Identified Violations**:
- Housing: 6 m²/person (requires 12 m²) → Deficit: 6 m²
- Water: 15 L/day (requires 20 L/day) → Deficit: 5 L/day
- Relationships: 1 close bond (requires 2) → Deficit: 1 bond
- Income: 200% poverty line → ✓ Complies

**Calculation**:
```
Housing: (12-6)/12 × 0.25 × 12 months × 2.0 = 3.0 points
Water:   (20-15)/20 × 0.25 × 12 months × 1.5 = 1.125 points
Relationships: (2-1)/2 × 0.10 × 12 months × 1.0 = 0.6 points

Total VDF-H Violation = 4.725 points
```

**Interpretation Scale**:
| Range | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| 0-2 points | Mild violation |
| 2-5 points | Moderate violation ← This case |
| 5-10 points | Severe violation |
| >10 points | Extreme violation |

## 8.6 Measurement and Audit Protocols

### Required Measurement Tools

| Category | Instruments |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Spatial** | Laser tape measure, GPS, mapping drones |
| **Air** | PM2.5/PM10 monitors, NO₂/SO₂/O₃ meters |
| **Water** | Bacteriological analysis kits, pH, chlorine, metals |
| **Health** | Scale, stadiometer, sphygmomanometer, oximeter |
| **Nutrition** | Food insecurity scales, anthropometry |
| **Housing** | Thermometer, hygrometer, luxmeter, sound level meter |
| **Social** | Validated questionnaires on social support, loneliness |

### Measurement Frequencies

| Frequency | Parameters |
|------------|------------|
| **Daily** | Air quality, water availability, sleep hours |
| **Weekly** | Nutrition, social interactions, work conditions |
| **Monthly** | Income, expenses, service access |
| **Quarterly** | Physical health, education, community participation |
| **Annual** | Housing, legal security, professional development |

### Independent Audits

## 8.7 Human VDF vs. Animal VDF: A Necessary Comparison

Vital Ontometry is coherent. Just as we define VDF for hens (Chapter 4), we apply the same logic to humans:

| Dimension | Hen VDF | Human VDF | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Space** | 0.25-0.75 m² | 9-60 m² | Humans require 36-240× more |
| **Water** | 0.5 L/day | 20-100 L/day | Humans require 40-200× more |
| **Social** | Groups of 15 | Complex bonds + community | Greater relational complexity |
| **Purpose** | Natural behavior | Work + Education + Participation | Exclusively human dimensions |
| **Zero Cruelty** | 0% painful practices | 0% torture/inhumane treatment | **Universal** |
| **Freedom of Movement** | 8 hours/day | Unlimited right | Different scale, same principle |

**Conclusion**: The principle is the same: **respect the biological and psychological design of the being.** Treating a human like a work machine is as violent as treating a hen like an egg machine.

---

## 8.8 Implementation: Radical Audit

Who guarantees compliance? We don't rely only on goodwill.

### 1. Measurement Technology
- Public air quality sensors.
- Satellite housing data.
- Wellbeing surveys on blockchain.
- **Poverty cannot hide if data is public.**

### 2. Independent Audit
- Technical bodies (not political) verify compliance quarterly.
- International standards certification.
- Global data comparability.

### 3. Economic Consequence
In Maxocracy, a region with a high Index of VDF Violation automatically receives injections of **Vital Time** (resources) from regions with surplus, without passing through political bureaucracy. It is a **social thermostat**.

## 8.9 The Incoherence of the Current System

VDF-H is a **truth-revealing** instrument. When applying parameters to global reality, disturbing evidence emerges:

| Violation | Affected Population | Dimension |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Without adequate sanitation | 3.6 billion | I.C Housing |
| Without safe drinking water | 2.2 billion | I.A Water |
| Chronic malnutrition | 828 million | I.B Nutrition |
| Inadequate housing | 1.6 billion | I.C Housing |
| Air above WHO thresholds | 7 billion | II.B Air |

These figures do not represent "development problems" but **massive and systematic violations of human dignity**, perpetrated or tolerated by those with power to remedy them.

---

## 8.10 Synthesis: The Minimum Species Contract

The VDF-H is the answer to our era's incoherence. We have technology for Mars, but allow 2 billion people to live without safe water.

Establishing this Floor is not charity; it is **systemic stability**. A society where no one falls into the abyss is a society without fear, and a society without fear is capable of true innovation and cooperation.

The VDF-H is the human species' minimum contract with itself.

The fundamental question is not if we can afford to implement the VDF-H, but if we can **morally afford not to**. In a world with sufficient resources to guarantee universal dignified life, every day of delay represents a deliberate decision to perpetuate avoidable suffering.
