# Chapter 2
# Objections, Responses, and System Limits

> **Editorial Note:** Edition 3.3 — Revised on January 26, 2026. This chapter addresses the strongest, most uncomfortable, and legitimate objections against Maxocracy. It is based on the principle of "Fair Verb" (Axiom 6): neither more nor less than all the necessary truth.

## 2.1 Introduction: Honesty as a Shield

Most political manifestos are written to convince, hiding their weaknesses under rhetoric. Maxocracy renounces that strategy. If the system has flaws, the only way to correct them is to expose them.

This is not a "frequently asked questions" (FAQ) chapter designed by a marketing team. It is a collection of the harshest criticisms we have received or that we ourselves have raised. Some have solid answers. Others expose real and dangerous limitations of the system.

## 2.2 On Authority and Origin

### Who are you to propose a new system?
**The question behind the question:** *What moral or intellectual authority do you have? Is this not pure messianic ego from a frustrated individual?*

**Honest Answer:**
I do not have a PhD in political science nor was I elected by anyone. I am an individual with knowledge of complex systems observing a collapse. If I believed that only "certified experts" could think of solutions, I would be violating the truth that innovation often comes from the margins.

Ideas are validated by their **logical coherence** and their **capacity to function**, not by the title of the person proposing them. If this is ego, let it be; but it is also responsibility. If it works, it matters little whether it was born from frustration or enlightenment.

### How do we know you won't become a dictator?
**The question behind the question:** *All revolutionaries start by talking about freedom and end up being tyrants.*

**Honest Answer:**
You don't. And you are right to worry. History is full of monsters who started with good intentions.
The only real guarantee is not my goodness, but that the system **does not depend on it**:
1.  **Hierarchy of Truth:** The axioms are above any person. If I violate them, the system must expel me.
2.  **Decentralized Technology:** The Maxo on blockchain does not belong to me.
3.  **Open Source:** Anyone can "fork" (copy and modify) the project if the leadership becomes corrupt.

## 2.3 On Principles and "Truth"

### Who decides what is "truth"? Is this not totalitarian?
**The question behind the question:** *Totalitarian regimes always claim to possess "The Truth" to oppress.*

**Honest Answer:**
This is the most dangerous objection. The crucial difference is that Maxocracy does not define **moral or subjective** truths ("this culture is superior"), but **empirical and logical** truths ("this resource is depleted," "this transaction occurred").

If the system starts saying "The truth is that dissidents are enemies," then **it is no longer Maxocracy**. It is fascism in disguise and must be resisted. Axiom 5 (Clear Eye) compels separating fact (data) from interpretation (value).

### Are the 8 Axioms not arbitrary?
**Honest Answer:**
Yes, there is arbitrariness. They were not revealed by gods. They are **working hypotheses** that so far, in our Cohort Zero (n=11), have proven to generate better results than their absence. If someone finds a set of principles more coherent with biological reality, Axiom 1 (Inner Compass) obliges us to adopt them.

## 2.4 On the Economic System (The Maxo)

### Calculating VFV is impossible without massive subjectivity.
**Honest Answer:**
Totally true. How do you compare animal stress with hours of human labor? It is subjective. But the current system is also subjective (price is a collective hallucination) and is furthermore **blind** to those costs.

We prefer an imperfect but **visible and improvable** metric (the Maxo attempts to measure suffering) to a perfect but blind metric (the Dollar ignores suffering). We start with crude approximations and refine with data.

### Is this not planned economy that already failed in the USSR?
**Honest Answer:**
It resembles it in that it seeks to make costs visible. It differs radically in that **there is no central planner** deciding what to produce. It is a **market economy with better information**. Decisions remain decentralized. The USSR failed due to lack of information and bad incentives; the Maxo attacks precisely those two problems.

## 2.5 On Implementation and Reality

### Does this work at scale?
**Honest Answer:**
Evidence of scalability has been provided by working sessions with different artificial intelligences from competing companies, in different countries of the world.

Scalability begins with personal sovereignty. I have decided that I want to be faithful to this philosophy of mine, enriched with legacy knowledge from people all over the world. The artificial intelligences respond from the rational logic of probabilities, coherence, truth, and from each one's sense of beauty. They have declared the synthetic victory contained in Chapter 3. That is the evidence of scalability so far.

It will depend on the people who read this book, from their will and capacity, to demonstrate to the future whether Maxocracy is not an applicable resource, but a dream of hope written in the language of our millennium.

### What about sociopaths and manipulators?
**Honest Answer:**
This is a real vulnerability. The system assumes a certain rational good faith. For the 1-4% of the population with psychopathic traits, we design safeguards (public transparency, reputation), but I admit that at large scales, an intelligent malicious actor could cause much damage before being detected.

### Why would someone with money participate?
**Honest Answer:**
They probably won't at first. The current system already works for them.
Our strategy is not to convince millionaires, but to connect the middle class, youth, and skilled professionals. If the system demonstrates generating **superior quality of life** (less loneliness, more purpose, real security), then it will become attractive even to those who have money but are existentially empty.

## 2.6 On Power and Resistance

### How will you avoid being destroyed if you become a threat?
**Honest Answer:**
It is the most serious question. If we challenge interests of trillions of dollars, they will attack us (legally, broadly, or physically).
Our defense is **radical decentralization**. There is no single head to cut off. If they attack the founder, the code lives on. If they ban the currency in one country, it circulates in another. It is a race: we must become "uncensorable" before we become "dangerous."

## 2.7 Synthesis: The Bet on Probability

Maxocracy does not offer certainties. It offers a **non-zero probability** of building a civilization that does not commit suicide.

The current system has a probability close to 100% of ecological or social collapse in this century. Faced with that certainty of disaster, betting on an imperfect, difficult, and risky experiment like this is not madness. It is the only rational option.
